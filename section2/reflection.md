## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- A growth mindset can greatly improve your ability to tackle new challenges
- A growth mindset implies that seeking help is a strength and not a weakness.
  Don't be afraid to ask for help, it's part of your professional growth.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
***I demonstrate a growth mindset by asking for help when I need it. I don't
demonstrate a growth mindset by waiting too long to ask for help.***
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
***A conditional statement is  a a feature of programming languages that tell the computer to execute an action as long as a specific condition is met***
**Examples**
### Example 1
```weather = 'snowy'

if weather == 'sunny'
  p "sunscreen"
elsif weather == 'rainy'
  p "umbrella"
elsif weather == 'snowy'
  p "coat"
elsif weather == 'icy'
  p "yak traks"
else
  p "good to go!"
end
```
### Example 2
```dog = 'dirty'

if dog == dirty
  puts "time for a bath."
elsif dog == 'not dirty'  
  puts "no bath required."
end
```
### Example 3
```cat = 'angry'

if cat == 'angry'
  puts "Don't pet the cat"
elsif cat == 'happy'
  puts "Pet the cat."
else
  puts "Better play it safe. Don't pet the cat."
end
```

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
***If statements are useful if you want the program to take action in response
to user information.***
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```if conditional [then]
  code...
end
```
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
***You can combine conditions by using `and` or `or` denoted by `&&` and `||`
To add multiple conditions to a an if statement, utilitze the elsif and else functions.***
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```if conditional [then]
  code...
elsif conditional [then]
  code...
else
  code...
end
```
